palindrome-checker
==================

(View Demo)[http://yourshoesuntied.com/palindrome-checker-demo/]

A simple application to determine if a given string is a palindrome.

This application was designed in response to a sample interview question.  It was simply an excercise in working through a problem that started in as
a conceptual programming discussion and ended as a coded solution.  Though I am sure the solution is still rough around te edges, it was a great little mini project to solve.
As it is, it may not be a very useful application but one can see how either the algorithm or the technique could be applied to other situations.
